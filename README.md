# Arcturus Morningstar #

## What is Arcturus Morningstar? ##
Arcturus Morningstar is the community project for the Arcturus Emulator by TheGeneral.

The community project was made because the Arcturus Emulator has been abandoned by TheGeneral with lack of updates, an intent to monetize the project, and make the project private.

TheGeneral's own words were "dont like it then dont use it". We did not like what he was doing, so we made our own version.

## Contributing ##
Anyone is allowed to fork the project and make pull requests. We make no guarantee that pull requests will be approved into the project.

## Branches ##
There will be 2 branches of the Arcturus Morningstar emulator:

`master` - The master branch will be the stable branch. Everything here has been tested on a live hotel and contains no known problems.

`dev` - The dev branch will be the unstable branch. This one is the most up to date, but things may not work as intended.

There is no set timeframe on when new versions will be released or when the stable branch will be updated.

## Custom features ##
Do not implement custom features into the source.
A custom feature will be defined as a feature or ability which is not possible in Habbo.com
Use plugins for custom features, and if a plugin is not possible, you should adapt the source to enable plugins to do that.

## Why always make things as plugins? ##
Why always make things as plugins?
1. Other people will see that plugins are the normal way of adding custom features
2. Plugins can be added and removed at the hotel owner's choice, it makes customizing the hotel easier
3. Developers will be able to read plugin source code to learn how to make their own plugins, without the need to look in complicated source code

## Making money ##
We have no problem with developers making money through the sale of custom features, plugins or maintenance work.

Sale of a special edition of a *source code* will not be permitted. You may use your own private edition of a source code, but we will not help you if you have any problems with it.

If we ever are to make paid features or plugins, we will not prevent or discourage developers from creating alternative options for users.
